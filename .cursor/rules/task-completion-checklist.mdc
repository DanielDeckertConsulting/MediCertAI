# Task completion checklist

Before considering a task done:

- **How to test:** Provide clear "How to test" steps (commands or manual steps) so others can verify the change.
- **Tests:** If behavior changed, add or adjust tests accordingly. New endpoints or validation rules need tests.
- **Impact:** For user-facing or flow-critical work, state impact level (e.g. Golden Path: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) and ensure critical paths are covered by tests if impacted.
- **Lists:** User-facing lists (tables, feeds, dashboards) must have loading, empty, and error states — not only the happy path.
- **Breaking changes:** Avoid breaking changes without an explicit migration path (e.g. API contract, schema, or config). If unavoidable, document the migration and rollback.
