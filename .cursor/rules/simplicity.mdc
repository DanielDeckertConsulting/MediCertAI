# Simplicity

- **Prefer simple solutions** over overengineering. Choose the minimal design that meets the requirement and is maintainable.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction, extra layers, or premature scaling complexity. When in doubt, implement the straightforward version first; refactor when real need appears.
- Use the arch-guard skill when reviewing architecture decisions or new services to keep complexity in check.
