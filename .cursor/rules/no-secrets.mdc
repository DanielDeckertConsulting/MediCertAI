# No secrets in code

- **Never commit** API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings, or any secret. Load them from environment variables or a secure store (e.g. Key Vault, secrets manager).
- Do not hardcode secrets in source, config files under version control, or logs. Use placeholders in examples and docs (e.g. `API_KEY=your_key_here`).
- If you add or change code that uses credentials, ensure the implementation reads from env or a secure store, not from literals. Exclude `.env` with real values from commits.
