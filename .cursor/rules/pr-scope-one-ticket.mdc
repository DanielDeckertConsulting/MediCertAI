# PR and scope

- **One ticket/feature per PR.** Do not bundle unrelated changes. If a feature is large, split into Phase 1 + follow-up tickets.
- **No scope creep.** Keep the change set minimal and cohesive. Avoid unrelated refactors or "while we're here" edits.
- When reviewing, check that changed files and behavior match the ticket scope; use the scope-guard skill when validating a PR.
